\chapter{Stacks and LIFO}

Stacks are fundamental data structures in computer science, characterized by their Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) behavior. They play a crucial role in various algorithms and system functionalities, from expression evaluation to memory management. This chapter explores the history, fundamental concepts, implementations, and applications of stacks, providing a comprehensive understanding of their significance in computing.

\section{Introduction to Stacks}\marginpar{Stacks are analogous to a stack of plates where the last plate placed on top is the first one to be removed.}

A \textbf{stack} is a linear data structure that follows the \textbf{Last-In, First-Out (LIFO)} principle. This means the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed. Stacks allow two primary operations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{push}: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
    \item \texttt{pop}: Removes the element from the top of the stack.
\end{itemize}

Additionally, stacks often support operations such as \texttt{peek} (or \texttt{top}), which returns the top element without removing it, and \texttt{isEmpty}, which checks whether the stack is empty.

\section{History of Stacks}\marginpar{The concept of stacks dates back to the early days of computing and mathematical logic.}

The concept of stacks emerged in the context of mathematical logic and computing in the mid-20th century. Early computing pioneers recognized the need for a data structure that could manage nested function calls and expression evaluations.

\subsection{Early Development}

In the 1950s, the Polish mathematician Jan Łukasiewicz introduced \textbf{Polish notation}, a prefix notation for logical expressions without the need for parentheses. Later, \textbf{Reverse Polish Notation (RPN)} was developed, which placed operators after their operands. RPN is inherently stack-based and influenced the development of stack data structures.\marginpar{Reverse Polish Notation is used in some calculators and programming languages for its simplicity in expression evaluation.}

\subsection{Stacks in Programming Languages}

The introduction of recursive function calls in programming languages necessitated a mechanism to keep track of function calls and local variables. This led to the implementation of the \textbf{call stack} in the runtime environment of languages like ALGOL and later in C and its derivatives.\marginpar{The call stack is essential for managing function calls, parameters, and return addresses during program execution.}

\section{Fundamental Concepts of LIFO}

The LIFO property of stacks makes them suitable for scenarios where the most recently added data needs to be accessed first. This section delves into the fundamental concepts that underpin stacks and their operations.

\subsection{Stack Operations}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Push Operation:} Adds an element to the top of the stack.
    \item \textbf{Pop Operation:} Removes and returns the top element of the stack.
    \item \textbf{Peek (Top) Operation:} Returns the top element without removing it.
    \item \textbf{isEmpty Operation:} Checks if the stack has no elements.
\end{itemize}\marginpar{Efficient stack operations typically run in constant \(O(1)\) time.}

\subsection{Stack Representation}

Stacks can be implemented using arrays (static stacks) or linked lists (dynamic stacks). The choice of implementation affects the flexibility and memory usage of the stack.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Array-Based Stacks:} Use a fixed-size array to store elements. Simple and efficient but have a fixed capacity.\marginpar{Array-based stacks are straightforward but may face overflow if capacity is exceeded.}
    \item \textbf{Linked List-Based Stacks:} Use nodes connected via pointers. Dynamic in size, growing and shrinking as needed.\marginpar{Linked list stacks avoid overflow but have overhead due to node pointers.}
\end{itemize}

\section{Implementations of Stacks}

Implementing a stack involves managing the addition and removal of elements while maintaining the LIFO order. Below are common ways to implement stacks in programming languages.

\subsection{Array Implementation}

An array-based stack uses an array and a variable to track the index of the top element.

\begin{fullwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
class ArrayStack:
    def __init__(self, capacity):
        self.stack = [None] * capacity
        self.top = -1  # Initialize top at -1 to indicate an empty stack
        self.capacity = capacity

    def push(self, item):
        if self.top >= self.capacity - 1:
            raise Exception("Stack Overflow")
        self.top += 1
        self.stack[self.top] = item

    def pop(self):
        if self.top == -1:
            raise Exception("Stack Underflow")
        item = self.stack[self.top]
        self.top -= 1
        return item

    def peek(self):
        if self.top == -1:
            return None
        return self.stack[self.top]

    def isEmpty(self):
        return self.top == -1
\end{lstlisting}
\end{fullwidth}\marginpar{Array stacks are efficient but require careful handling of overflow and underflow conditions.}

\subsection{Linked List Implementation}

A linked list-based stack uses nodes where each node contains data and a reference to the next node.

\begin{fullwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None

class LinkedListStack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None  # Initialize head to None

    def push(self, item):
        new_node = Node(item)
        new_node.next = self.head  # New node points to the former head
        self.head = new_node       # Head is now the new node

    def pop(self):
        if self.head is None:
            raise Exception("Stack Underflow")
        item = self.head.data
        self.head = self.head.next  # Move head to the next node
        return item

    def peek(self):
        if self.head is None:
            return None
        return self.head.data

    def isEmpty(self):
        return self.head is None
\end{lstlisting}
\end{fullwidth}\marginpar{Linked list stacks offer dynamic sizing but involve additional memory overhead per node.}

\section{Applications of Stacks}\marginpar{Stacks are integral to many algorithms and system processes.}

Stacks are employed in a wide array of applications due to their LIFO nature. Below are some common use cases.

\subsection{Expression Evaluation and Conversion}

Stacks are used to evaluate expressions in postfix (RPN) notation and to convert infix expressions to postfix or prefix notation.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Expression Evaluation:} Operands and operators are processed using stacks to compute the result of an expression.\marginpar{Stack-based evaluation avoids the need for parentheses in expressions.}
    \item \textbf{Syntax Parsing:} Compilers use stacks to parse expressions and check for balanced parentheses.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Function Call Management}

The call stack is a stack data structure that stores information about active subroutines or functions in a program.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Recursion Handling:} Each recursive call adds a new frame to the call stack.\marginpar{Excessive recursion can lead to stack overflow errors.}
    \item \textbf{Local Variables and Return Addresses:} The call stack keeps track of local variables and return points for function calls.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Undo Mechanisms}

Applications like text editors use stacks to implement undo and redo functionalities.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Undo Operation:} User actions are pushed onto a stack; undo pops the last action.\marginpar{Stacks enable reversal of actions in the order they occurred.}
    \item \textbf{Redo Operation:} A separate stack can manage redo actions by storing undone operations.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Depth-First Search (DFS)}

Stacks are utilized in graph algorithms, particularly in implementing non-recursive DFS.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Traversal Order:} Stacks ensure that the most recently discovered node is processed next.
    \item \textbf{Backtracking:} Stacks facilitate backtracking by keeping track of the path taken.\marginpar{DFS can be implemented recursively or iteratively using a stack.}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Memory Management}

Stacks play a role in memory allocation and deallocation processes.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Stack Memory:} Used for static memory allocation, managing function call frames.
    \item \textbf{Heap vs. Stack:} Understanding the difference is crucial for efficient memory usage.\marginpar{Stack memory is faster but limited in size compared to heap memory.}
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion}

Stacks are a fundamental component of computer science, providing an efficient way to manage data that adheres to the LIFO principle. Their simplicity and versatility make them suitable for a wide range of applications, from expression evaluation to memory management. Understanding stacks is essential for developing efficient algorithms and solving complex computational problems.

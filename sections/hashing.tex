\chapter{Hashing and Hash Tables}
\label{chap:Hashing_and_Hash_Tables}

Hashing and hash tables are cornerstone concepts in computer science, providing a powerful and efficient way to store and retrieve data. Hashing maps data to fixed-size values, called hash codes, which can be used as indices in a hash table. This mechanism allows for fast lookups, insertions, and deletions in constant average time, \(O(1)\). The versatility and efficiency of hashing make it a fundamental tool for solving a wide variety of problems, from data retrieval to detecting duplicates and implementing associative arrays.

In this chapter, we will explore the principles behind hashing, understand how hash tables work, and discuss their applications and limitations.

\section*{What is Hashing?}
Hashing is the process of converting input data (such as a string, number, or object) into a fixed-size hash code using a hash function. The goal is to distribute the input data uniformly across a range of hash codes to minimize collisions\sidenote{A collision occurs when two different inputs produce the same hash code. Managing collisions effectively is crucial for maintaining the efficiency of a hash table}.

\subsection*{Properties of a Good Hash Function}
A good hash function should:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Be Deterministic:} The same input should always produce the same hash code.
    \item \textbf{Distribute Uniformly:} Hash codes should be spread evenly across the range to reduce collisions.
    \item \textbf{Be Efficient:} The computation of the hash code should be fast, ideally \(O(1)\).
    \item \textbf{Minimize Collisions:} Although collisions are unavoidable, a good hash function reduces their likelihood\sidenote{Perfect hash functions exist for certain datasets but are impractical for general use cases}.
\end{itemize}

\section*{What is a Hash Table?}
A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values using hashing. It is implemented as an array where the index for storing a key-value pair is determined by applying a hash function to the key.

\subsection*{Key Operations in a Hash Table}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Insertion:} Compute the hash code for a key, map it to an index, and store the value at that index.
    \item \textbf{Search:} Compute the hash code for the key and retrieve the value at the corresponding index.
    \item \textbf{Deletion:} Compute the hash code for the key and remove the value at the corresponding index.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Collision Resolution Techniques}
Collisions occur when two keys hash to the same index. Hash tables manage collisions using techniques like:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Chaining:} Store multiple key-value pairs at the same index using a linked list or a dynamic array\sidenote{Chaining is simple and allows for flexible resizing but requires extra memory for the additional structures}.
    \item \textbf{Open Addressing:} Probe sequentially or using a specific strategy (e.g., linear probing, quadratic probing, or double hashing) to find the next available slot in the table\sidenote{Open addressing is memory-efficient but can suffer from clustering}.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Applications of Hashing and Hash Tables}
Hashing and hash tables are integral to solving a wide variety of problems, including:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Duplicate Detection:} Quickly determine if duplicate elements exist in a dataset.
    \item \textbf{Frequency Counting:} Count occurrences of elements in linear time.
    \item \textbf{Anagram Detection:} Use hash tables to compare character frequencies efficiently.
    \item \textbf{Caching:} Implement efficient caching systems using hash tables (e.g., Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache).
    \item \textbf{Hash-Based Data Structures:} Implement sets, dictionaries, and associative arrays.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Advantages of Hash Tables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Constant Time Operations:} On average, hash tables provide \(O(1)\) time complexity for insertion, search, and deletion.
    \item \textbf{Flexibility:} Hash tables can handle a wide range of key types, including strings, numbers, and composite objects.
    \item \textbf{Dynamic Size:} Many hash table implementations (e.g., Pythonâ€™s dictionaries) dynamically resize to maintain efficiency.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Challenges and Limitations of Hash Tables}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Collisions:} Poorly chosen hash functions can lead to frequent collisions, degrading performance to \(O(n)\).
    \item \textbf{Memory Overhead:} Hash tables require extra space for unused slots or chaining structures.
    \item \textbf{Non-Ordered Data:} Hash tables do not maintain the order of elements, making them unsuitable for problems requiring sorted data.
\end{itemize}

Examples of problems that leverage hashing include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Two Sum:} Find two numbers in an array that add up to a target sum.
    \item \textbf{Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters:} Use hashing to track characters and efficiently manage the sliding window.
    \item \textbf{Find All Anagrams in a String:} Use frequency counts and hashing for efficient pattern matching.

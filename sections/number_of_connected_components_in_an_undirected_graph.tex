\section*{Algorithmic Approach}

To solve the \textbf{Number of Connected Components in an Undirected Graph} problem efficiently, the Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) data structure is employed. Union-Find is particularly effective for managing and merging disjoint sets, which aligns perfectly with the task of identifying connected components in a graph.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Initialize Union-Find Structure:}  
    Each node starts as its own parent, indicating that each node is initially in its own set.

    \item \textbf{Process Each Edge:}  
    For every undirected edge \((u, v)\), perform a union operation to merge the sets containing nodes \(u\) and \(v\).

    \item \textbf{Count Unique Parents:}  
    After processing all edges, count the number of unique parents. Each unique parent represents a distinct connected component.
\end{enumerate}

\marginnote{Using Union-Find with path compression and union by rank optimizes the operations, ensuring near-constant time complexity for each union and find operation.}

\section*{Complexities}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Time Complexity:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{Union-Find Operations}: Each union and find operation takes nearly \(O(1)\) time due to optimizations like path compression and union by rank.
        \item \texttt{Processing All Edges}: \(O(E \cdot \alpha(n))\), where \(E\) is the number of edges and \(\alpha\) is the inverse Ackermann function, which grows very slowly.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Space Complexity:} \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes. This space is used to store the parent and rank arrays.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Python Implementation}

\marginnote{Implementing Union-Find with path compression and union by rank ensures optimal performance for determining connected components.}

Below is the complete Python code using the Union-Find algorithm with path compression for finding the number of connected components in an undirected graph:

\begin{fullwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.parent = [i for i in range(size)]
        self.rank = [1] * size
        self.count = size  # Initially, each node is its own component

    def find(self, x):
        if self.parent[x] != x:
            self.parent[x] = self.find(self.parent[x])  # Path compression
        return self.parent[x]

    def union(self, x, y):
        rootX = self.find(x)
        rootY = self.find(y)

        if rootX == rootY:
            return

        # Union by rank
        if self.rank[rootX] > self.rank[rootY]:
            self.parent[rootY] = rootX
            self.rank[rootX] += self.rank[rootY]
        else:
            self.parent[rootX] = rootY
            if self.rank[rootX] == self.rank[rootY]:
                self.rank[rootY] += 1
        self.count -= 1  # Reduce count of components when a union is performed

class Solution:
    def countComponents(self, n, edges):
        uf = UnionFind(n)
        for u, v in edges:
            uf.union(u, v)
        return uf.count

# Example usage:
solution = Solution()
print(solution.countComponents(5, [[0, 1], [1, 2], [3, 4]]))  # Output: 2
print(solution.countComponents(5, [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]]))  # Output: 1
\end{lstlisting}
\end{fullwidth}

\section*{Explanation}

The provided Python implementation utilizes the Union-Find data structure to efficiently determine the number of connected components in an undirected graph. Here's a detailed breakdown of the implementation:

\subsection*{Data Structures}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{parent}:  
    An array where \texttt{parent[i]} represents the parent of node \texttt{i}. Initially, each node is its own parent, indicating separate components.

    \item \texttt{rank}:  
    An array used to keep track of the depth of each tree. This helps in optimizing the \texttt{union} operation by attaching the smaller tree under the root of the larger tree.

    \item \texttt{count}:  
    A counter that keeps track of the number of connected components. It is initialized to the total number of nodes and decremented each time a successful union operation merges two distinct components.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Union-Find Operations}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Find Operation (\texttt{find(x)})}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \texttt{find} determines the root parent of node \texttt{x}.
        \item Path compression is applied by recursively setting the parent of each traversed node directly to the root. This flattens the tree structure, optimizing future \texttt{find} operations.
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \item \textbf{Union Operation (\texttt{union(x, y)})}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Find the root parents of both nodes \texttt{x} and \texttt{y}.
        \item If both nodes share the same root, they are already in the same connected component, and no action is taken.
        \item If they have different roots, perform a union by rank:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Attach the tree with the lower rank under the root of the tree with the higher rank.
            \item If both trees have the same rank, arbitrarily choose one as the new root and increment its rank.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Decrement the \texttt{count} of connected components since two separate components have been merged.
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \item \textbf{Connected Operation (\texttt{connected(x, y)})}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Determine if nodes \texttt{x} and \texttt{y} share the same root parent using the \texttt{find} operation.
        \item Return \texttt{True} if they are connected; otherwise, return \texttt{False}.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Solution Class (\texttt{Solution})}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Initialize the Union-Find structure with \texttt{n} nodes.
    \item Iterate through each edge \((u, v)\) and perform a union operation to merge the sets containing \(u\) and \(v\).
    \item After processing all edges, return the \texttt{count} of connected components.
\end{enumerate}

This approach ensures that each union and find operation is performed efficiently, resulting in an overall time complexity that is nearly linear with respect to the number of nodes and edges.

\section*{Why this Approach}

The Union-Find algorithm is particularly suited for connectivity problems in graphs due to its ability to efficiently merge sets and determine the connectivity between elements. Compared to other graph traversal methods like Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS), Union-Find offers superior performance in scenarios involving multiple connectivity queries and dynamic graph structures. The optimizations of path compression and union by rank further enhance its efficiency, making it an optimal choice for large-scale graphs.

\section*{Alternative Approaches}

While Union-Find is highly efficient, other methods can also be used to determine the number of connected components:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Depth-First Search (DFS):}  
    Perform DFS starting from each unvisited node, marking all reachable nodes as part of the same component. Increment the component count each time a new DFS traversal is initiated.
    
    \item \textbf{Breadth-First Search (BFS):}  
    Similar to DFS, BFS can be used to traverse and mark nodes within the same connected component. Increment the component count with each new BFS traversal.
\end{itemize}

Both DFS and BFS have a time complexity of \(O(V + E)\) and are effective for static graphs. However, Union-Find tends to be more efficient for dynamic connectivity queries and when dealing with multiple merge operations.

\section*{Similar Problems to This One}

This problem is closely related to several other connectivity and graph-related problems:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Redundant Connection:}  
    Identify and remove a redundant edge that creates a cycle in the graph.

    \item \textbf{Graph Valid Tree:}

    \index{Accounts Merge}
    
    \item \textbf{Friend Circles:}  
    Find the number of friend circles in a social network.
    \index{Friend Circles}

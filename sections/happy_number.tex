The \textbf{Happy Number} problem is an intriguing algorithmic challenge that involves determining whether a given number is "happy". A happy number is defined by a specific iterative process: starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits. Repeat this process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle that does not include 1. This problem tests one's ability to implement cycle detection algorithms and understand iterative processes in numerical computations.

\section*{Problem Statement}

Determine if a number is a "happy number".

A happy number is defined by the following process:
- Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
- Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle that does not include 1.
- Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

Return \texttt{True} if \texttt{n} is a happy number, and \texttt{False} otherwise.

\section*{Algorithmic Approach}

To determine whether a number \(n\) is a happy number, we can utilize cycle detection algorithms. The most efficient methods involve using the **Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm**, also known as the **Tortoise and Hare** algorithm. This approach allows us to detect cycles without the need for additional memory, ensuring an optimal solution.

\subsection*{1. Floyd's Cycle Detection (Two Pointers Approach)}

The idea is to use two pointers that move through the sequence of numbers generated by the sum of the squares of the digits:
- **Slow Pointer (Tortoise):** Moves one step at a time.
- **Fast Pointer (Hare):** Moves two steps at a time.

If the number is happy, the fast pointer will eventually reach 1. If the number is not happy, the fast and slow pointers will eventually meet in a cycle that does not include 1.

\subsection*{2. Sum of Squares of Digits Function}

A helper function computes the sum of the squares of the digits of a given number. This function is central to generating the next number in the sequence.

\marginnote{Floyd's Cycle Detection efficiently detects cycles with \(O(1)\) space complexity by using two pointers moving at different speeds.}

\section*{Complexities}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Time Complexity:} The time complexity is \(O(k)\), where \(k\) is the number of steps required to either reach 1 or detect a cycle. In practice, \(k\) is bounded and does not depend on the size of the input.
    
    \item \textbf{Space Complexity:} \(O(1)\), since no additional space is used beyond a few variables for the pointers and intermediate calculations.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Python Implementation}

\marginnote{Floyd's Cycle Detection allows for efficient cycle detection without additional memory overhead.}

Below is the complete Python code implementing the \texttt{isHappy} function using Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm:

\begin{fullwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
class Solution:
    def isHappy(self, n: int) -> bool:
        def get_next(number):
            total_sum = 0
            while number > 0:
                number, digit = divmod(number, 10)
                total_sum += digit ** 2
            return total_sum
        
        slow_runner = n
        fast_runner = get_next(n)
        
        while fast_runner != 1 and slow_runner != fast_runner:
            slow_runner = get_next(slow_runner)
            fast_runner = get_next(get_next(fast_runner))
        
        return fast_runner == 1

# Example usage:
solution = Solution()
print(solution.isHappy(19))  # Output: True
print(solution.isHappy(2))   # Output: False
print(solution.isHappy(0))   # Output: False
\end{lstlisting}
\end{fullwidth}

This implementation defines a helper function \texttt{get\_next} to calculate the sum of the squares of the digits of the current number. Two pointers, \texttt{slow\_runner} and \texttt{fast\_runner}, are used to traverse the sequence. The loop continues until either the fast pointer reaches 1 (indicating a happy number) or the slow and fast pointers meet (indicating a cycle).

\section*{Explanation}

The \texttt{isHappy} function determines whether a given number \(n\) is a happy number by leveraging Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm. Here's a detailed breakdown of the implementation:

\subsection*{1. Helper Function: \texttt{get\_next}}

\begin{itemize}
    \item **Purpose:** Computes the sum of the squares of the digits of a given number.
    \item **Implementation:**
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Initialize \texttt{total\_sum} to 0.
        \item Iterate through each digit of the number:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Use \texttt{divmod} to extract the last digit and reduce the number.
            \item Add the square of the digit to \texttt{total\_sum}.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Return the computed \texttt{total\_sum}.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{2. Two Pointers Initialization}

\begin{itemize}
    \item **Slow Pointer (\texttt{slow\_runner}):** Initialized to the original number \(n\).
    \item **Fast Pointer (\texttt{fast\_runner}):** Initialized to the next number in the sequence by applying \texttt{get\_next(n)}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{3. Iterative Process}

\begin{itemize}
    \item **Condition:** Continue looping while \texttt{fast\_runner} is not 1 and the two pointers do not meet.
    \item **Steps:**
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Move the \texttt{slow\_runner} one step forward by applying \texttt{get\_next} once.
        \item Move the \texttt{fast\_runner} two steps forward by applying \texttt{get\_next} twice.
    \end{itemize}
    \item **Termination:**
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If \texttt{fast\_runner} reaches 1, return \texttt{True} (happy number).
        \item If \texttt{slow\_runner} equals \texttt{fast\_runner}, return \texttt{False} (cycle detected).
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{4. Final Return}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Return \texttt{True} if \texttt{fast\_runner} is 1, otherwise return \texttt{False}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Example Walkthrough}

Consider \(n = 19\):

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \texttt{slow\_runner} = 19
    \item \texttt{fast\_runner} = get\_next(19) = 1² + 9² = 82
    \item **First Iteration:**
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{slow\_runner} = get\_next(19) = 82
        \item \texttt{fast\_runner} = get\_next(get\_next(82)) = get\_next(68) = 100
    \end{itemize}
    \item **Second Iteration:**
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{slow\_runner} = get\_next(82) = 68
        \item \texttt{fast\_runner} = get\_next(get\_next(100)) = get\_next(1) = 1
    \end{itemize}
    \item **Termination:**
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{fast\_runner} = 1, return \texttt{True}
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

Thus, 19 is a happy number.

\section*{Why This Approach}

Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm is chosen for its efficiency and minimal space usage. Unlike other methods that may require additional memory to track seen numbers (e.g., using a hash set), this approach uses two pointers to detect cycles, ensuring an optimal solution with constant space complexity.

\section*{Alternative Approaches}

\subsection*{1. Hash Set to Detect Cycles}

Store each number encountered in a hash set. If a number repeats, a cycle is detected, and the number is not happy.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
class Solution:
    def isHappy(self, n: int) -> bool:
        seen = set()
        while n != 1 and n not in seen:
            seen.add(n)
            n = sum(int(char) ** 2 for char in str(n))
        return n == 1
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{Complexities:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Time Complexity:} \(O(k)\), where \(k\) is the number of unique numbers before a cycle is detected or 1 is reached.
    \item \textbf{Space Complexity:} \(O(k)\), due to storage in the hash set.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{2. Recursive Approach}

Use recursion to follow the sequence of transformations, keeping track of visited numbers.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
class Solution:
    def isHappy(self, n: int) -> bool:
        def get_next(number):
            total_sum = 0
            while number > 0:
                number, digit = divmod(number, 10)
                total_sum += digit ** 2
            return total_sum
        
        def helper(number, seen):
            if number == 1:
                return True
            if number in seen:
                return False
            seen.add(number)
            return helper(get_next(number), seen)
        
        return helper(n, set())
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{Complexities:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Time Complexity:} \(O(k)\)
    \item \textbf{Space Complexity:} \(O(k)\) due to recursion stack and hash set.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Introduction}

Graphs are versatile and powerful data structures used to model relationships and connections between entities. Whether representing social networks, transportation systems, or web page link structures, graphs provide a foundational framework for analyzing and solving a wide array of computational problems. This chapter delves into the core concepts of graphs, their various types and representations, essential traversal algorithms, and key graph algorithms that form the backbone of many applications in computer science and beyond.

\textbf{Graph Fundamentals}

\textbf{Definition:}  
A **graph** \( G \) is a collection of **vertices** (also called **nodes**) and **edges** that connect pairs of vertices. Formally, a graph can be defined as:
\[
G = (V, E)
\]
where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( V \) is a set of vertices.
    \item \( E \) is a set of edges, each edge being a pair of vertices.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Terminology:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Vertex (Node)}: An individual entity within the graph.
    \item \textbf{Edge}: A connection between two vertices.
    \item \textbf{Directed Graph (Digraph)}: A graph where edges have a direction, indicating a one-way relationship.
    \item \textbf{Undirected Graph}: A graph where edges have no direction, indicating a bidirectional relationship.
    \item \textbf{Weighted Graph}: A graph where edges have associated weights or costs.
    \item \textbf{Unweighted Graph}: A graph where edges do not have weights.
    \item \textbf{Adjacency}: Two vertices are adjacent if they are connected by an edge.
    \item \textbf{Degree}: The number of edges incident to a vertex. In directed graphs, we distinguish between \textbf{in-degree} and \textbf{out-degree}.
    \item \textbf{Path}: A sequence of vertices where each consecutive pair is connected by an edge.
    \item \textbf{Cycle}: A path that starts and ends at the same vertex without repeating any edges or vertices.
    \item \textbf{Connected Graph}: An undirected graph where there is a path between every pair of vertices.
    \item \textbf{Strongly Connected Graph}: A directed graph where there is a directed path between every pair of vertices.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Types of Graphs}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Simple Graph}: An undirected graph with no loops (edges connecting a vertex to itself) and no multiple edges between the same pair of vertices.
    \item \textbf{Multigraph}: A graph that allows multiple edges between the same pair of vertices.
    \item \textbf{Complete Graph}: A graph where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by a unique edge.
    \item \textbf{Bipartite Graph}: A graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that every edge connects a vertex from one set to the other.
    \item \textbf{Tree}: A connected acyclic undirected graph.
    \item \textbf{Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)}: A directed graph with no cycles, commonly used to represent dependencies.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Graph Representations}

Choosing the right graph representation is crucial for the efficiency of graph algorithms. The most common representations are:

\subsection{Adjacency Matrix}

An adjacency matrix is a 2D array where the element at row \( i \) and column \( j \) indicates the presence (and possibly the weight) of an edge between vertices \( i \) and \( j \).

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Pros}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Easy to implement.
        \item \( O(1) \) time complexity for checking the existence of an edge.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Cons}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Requires \( O(V^2) \) space, which can be inefficient for sparse graphs.
        \item Iterating over all neighbors of a vertex takes \( O(V) \) time.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Adjacency List}

An adjacency list represents a graph as an array of lists. The index of the array represents a vertex, and each element in the list at that index represents the vertices adjacent to that vertex.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Pros}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item More space-efficient for sparse graphs (\( O(V + E) \) space).
        \item Faster iteration over neighbors.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Cons}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Checking for the existence of a specific edge can take \( O(V) \) time in the worst case.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Edge List}

An edge list is a collection of all edges in the graph, typically represented as pairs (or triplets if weighted).

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Pros}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Simple and space-efficient for very sparse graphs.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Cons}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Inefficient for algorithms that require quick access to adjacent vertices.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Graph Traversal Algorithms}

Graph traversal algorithms explore nodes and edges of a graph systematically. The two fundamental traversal techniques are:

\subsection{Breadth-First Search (BFS)}

\textbf{Description:}  
BFS explores the graph level by level, starting from a source vertex and visiting all its neighbors before moving to the next level.

\textbf{Applications:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Shortest path in unweighted graphs.
    \item Finding connected components.
    \item Bipartite checking.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Algorithm Steps:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Initialize a queue and enqueue the starting vertex.
    \item Mark the starting vertex as visited.
    \item While the queue is not empty:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Dequeue a vertex from the queue.
        \item For each adjacent vertex:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item If it hasn't been visited, mark it as visited and enqueue it.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Python Implementation:}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, xleftmargin=0.02\textwidth, xrightmargin=0.02\textwidth]
from collections import deque

def bfs(graph, start):
    visited = set()
    queue = deque([start])
    visited.add(start)
    
    while queue:
        vertex = queue.popleft()
        print(vertex, end=' ')
        for neighbor in graph[vertex]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append(neighbor)

# Example Usage:
graph = {
    'A': ['B', 'C'],
    'B': ['D', 'E'],
    'C': ['F'],
    'D': [],
    'E': ['F'],
    'F': []
}

print("BFS Traversal starting from vertex 'A':")
bfs(graph, 'A')  # Output: A B C D E F 
\end{lstlisting}
\marginpar{The BFS algorithm traverses the graph level by level, ensuring the shortest path in unweighted graphs.}

\subsection{Depth-First Search (DFS)}

\textbf{Description:}  
DFS explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking, effectively diving deep into the graph's structure.

\textbf{Applications:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Topological sorting.
    \item Detecting cycles.
    \item Solving puzzles and mazes.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Algorithm Steps:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Start at a source vertex and mark it as visited.
    \item Recursively visit each unvisited neighbor.
    \item Backtrack when no unvisited neighbors remain.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Python Implementation (Recursive):}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, xleftmargin=0.02\textwidth, xrightmargin=0.02\textwidth]
def dfs_recursive(graph, vertex, visited=None):
    if visited is None:
        visited = set()
    visited.add(vertex)
    print(vertex, end=' ')
    for neighbor in graph[vertex]:
        if neighbor not in visited:
            dfs_recursive(graph, neighbor, visited)

# Example Usage:
print("\nDFS Traversal starting from vertex 'A':")
dfs_recursive(graph, 'A')  # Output: A B D E F C 
\end{lstlisting}
\marginpar{The DFS algorithm explores each path deeply before backtracking, making it suitable for tasks like cycle detection.}

\textbf{Graph Algorithms}

Beyond traversal, several key algorithms operate on graphs to solve complex problems:

\subsection{Shortest Path Algorithms}

\textbf{1. Dijkstra's Algorithm}

\textbf{Description:}  
Finds the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph with non-negative edge weights.

\textbf{Algorithm Steps:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Initialize distances from the source to all vertices as infinity, except the source itself (distance = 0).
    \item Use a priority queue (min-heap) to select the vertex with the smallest tentative distance.
    \item For the selected vertex, update the distances of its adjacent vertices.
    \item Repeat until all vertices are processed.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Python Implementation:}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, xleftmargin=0.02\textwidth, xrightmargin=0.02\textwidth]
import heapq

def dijkstra(graph, start):
    queue = []
    heapq.heappush(queue, (0, start))
    distances = {vertex: float('inf') for vertex in graph}
    distances[start] = 0
    
    while queue:
        current_distance, current_vertex = heapq.heappop(queue)
        
        # Nodes can get added to the priority queue multiple times
        if current_distance > distances[current_vertex]:
            continue
        
        for neighbor, weight in graph[current_vertex]:
            distance = current_distance + weight
            
            # Only consider this new path if it's better
            if distance < distances[neighbor]:
                distances[neighbor] = distance
                heapq.heappush(queue, (distance, neighbor))
    
    return distances

# Example Usage:
weighted_graph = {
    'A': [('B', 1), ('C', 4)],
    'B': [('C', 2), ('D', 5)],
    'C': [('D', 1)],
    'D': []
}

distances = dijkstra(weighted_graph, 'A')
print("\nShortest distances from vertex 'A':")
for vertex in distances:
    print(f"Distance to {vertex}: {distances[vertex]}")
# Output:
# Distance to A: 0
# Distance to B: 1
# Distance to C: 3
# Distance to D: 4
\end{lstlisting}
\marginpar{Dijkstra's algorithm efficiently finds the shortest paths in graphs with non-negative edge weights using a priority queue.}

\textbf{2. Bellman-Ford Algorithm}

\textbf{Description:}  
Computes the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph, capable of handling negative edge weights and detecting negative cycles.

\textbf{Algorithm Steps:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Initialize distances from the source to all vertices as infinity, except the source itself (distance = 0).
    \item Relax all edges \( V - 1 \) times, where \( V \) is the number of vertices.
    \item Check for negative-weight cycles by verifying if any edge can still be relaxed.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Python Implementation:}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, xleftmargin=0.02\textwidth, xrightmargin=0.02\textwidth]
def bellman_ford(edges, num_vertices, start):
    distances = {vertex: float('inf') for vertex in range(num_vertices)}
    distances[start] = 0
    
    # Relax edges repeatedly
    for _ in range(num_vertices - 1):
        for (u, v, w) in edges:
            if distances[u] + w < distances[v]:
                distances[v] = distances[u] + w
    
    # Check for negative-weight cycles
    for (u, v, w) in edges:
        if distances[u] + w < distances[v]:
            raise ValueError("Graph contains a negative-weight cycle")
    
    return distances

# Example Usage:
# Graph represented as edge list: (source, destination, weight)
edges = [
    (0, 1, -1),
    (0, 2, 4),
    (1, 2, 3),
    (1, 3, 2),
    (1, 4, 2),
    (3, 2, 5),
    (3, 1, 1),
    (4, 3, -3)
]
num_vertices = 5
start_vertex = 0

distances = bellman_ford(edges, num_vertices, start_vertex)
print("\nShortest distances from vertex 0:")
for vertex in range(num_vertices):
    print(f"Distance to {vertex}: {distances[vertex]}")
# Output:
# Distance to 0: 0
# Distance to 1: -1
# Distance to 2: 2
# Distance to 3: -2
# Distance to 4: 1
\end{lstlisting}
\marginpar{Bellman-Ford algorithm handles graphs with negative edge weights and detects negative cycles by iteratively relaxing edges.}

\subsection{Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) Algorithms}

\textbf{1. Prim's Algorithm}

\textbf{Description:}  
Finds the MST of a connected, undirected, weighted graph by growing the spanning tree one vertex at a time, always choosing the minimum weight edge that connects a vertex in the tree to a vertex outside the tree.

\textbf{Algorithm Steps:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Initialize a priority queue with the starting vertex and edge weight as 0.
    \item While the queue is not empty and the MST does not include all vertices:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Extract the vertex with the smallest edge weight.
        \item If the vertex is not already in the MST, add it and its edge to the MST.
        \item Add all adjacent edges of the vertex to the priority queue.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Python Implementation:}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, xleftmargin=0.02\textwidth, xrightmargin=0.02\textwidth]
def prim_mst(graph, start):
    import heapq
    mst = []
    visited = set()
    min_heap = [(0, start, None)]  # (weight, vertex, parent)
    
    while min_heap and len(visited) < len(graph):
        weight, vertex, parent = heapq.heappop(min_heap)
        if vertex not in visited:
            visited.add(vertex)
            if parent is not None:
                mst.append((parent, vertex, weight))
            for neighbor, w in graph[vertex]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    heapq.heappush(min_heap, (w, neighbor, vertex))
    
    return mst

# Example Usage:
graph = {
    'A': [('B', 1), ('C', 4)],
    'B': [('A', 1), ('C', 2), ('D', 5)],
    'C': [('A', 4), ('B', 2), ('D', 1)],
    'D': [('B', 5), ('C', 1)]
}

mst = prim_mst(graph, 'A')
print("\nMinimum Spanning Tree using Prim's Algorithm:")
for edge in mst:
    print(edge)
# Output:
# ('A', 'B', 1)
# ('B', 'C', 2)
# ('C', 'D', 1)
\end{lstlisting}
\marginpar{Prim's algorithm efficiently constructs the MST by selecting the minimum weight edges connecting new vertices.}

\textbf{2. Kruskal's Algorithm}

\textbf{Description:}  
Finds the MST by sorting all edges in non-decreasing order of their weight and adding them one by one, ensuring that no cycles are formed, until all vertices are connected.

\textbf{Algorithm Steps:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Sort all edges in non-decreasing order of their weight.
    \item Initialize a disjoint-set (union-find) data structure to keep track of connected components.
    \item Iterate through the sorted edges:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item If the current edge connects two different components, add it to the MST and merge the components.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Python Implementation:}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, xleftmargin=0.02\textwidth, xrightmargin=0.02\textwidth]
class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self, vertices):
        self.parent = {vertex: vertex for vertex in vertices}
    
    def find(self, vertex):
        if self.parent[vertex] != vertex:
            self.parent[vertex] = self.find(self.parent[vertex])  # Path compression
        return self.parent[vertex]
    
    def union(self, vertex1, vertex2):
        root1 = self.find(vertex1)
        root2 = self.find(vertex2)
        if root1 != root2:
            self.parent[root2] = root1
            return True
        return False

def kruskal_mst(edges, vertices):
    mst = []
    uf = UnionFind(vertices)
    sorted_edges = sorted(edges, key=lambda x: x[2])
    
    for u, v, w in sorted_edges:
        if uf.union(u, v):
            mst.append((u, v, w))
    
    return mst

# Example Usage:
edges = [
    ('A', 'B', 1),
    ('B', 'C', 2),
    ('C', 'D', 1),
    ('A', 'C', 4),
    ('B', 'D', 5)
]
vertices = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']

mst = kruskal_mst(edges, vertices)
print("\nMinimum Spanning Tree using Kruskal's Algorithm:")
for edge in mst:
    print(edge)
# Output:
# ('A', 'B', 1)
# ('C', 'D', 1)
# ('B', 'C', 2)
\end{lstlisting}
\marginpar{Kruskal's algorithm constructs the MST by greedily adding the smallest edges while avoiding cycles using the union-find data structure.}

\subsection{Topological Sorting}

\textbf{Description:}  
Arranges the vertices of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) in a linear order such that for every directed edge \( uv \), vertex \( u \) comes before \( v \) in the ordering.

\textbf{Applications:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Task scheduling.
    \item Course prerequisite planning.
    \item Resolving symbol dependencies in linkers.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Algorithm Steps (Kahn's Algorithm):}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Compute the in-degree of each vertex.
    \item Initialize a queue with all vertices having in-degree 0.
    \item While the queue is not empty:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Dequeue a vertex and add it to the topological order.
        \item For each adjacent vertex, reduce its in-degree by 1. If in-degree becomes 0, enqueue it.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item If the topological order includes all vertices, return the order. Otherwise, the graph has at least one cycle.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Python Implementation:}

            if in_degree[v] == 0:
                queue.append(v)
    
    if len(topo_order) == len(graph):
        return topo_order
    else:
        raise ValueError("Graph has at least one cycle")

# Example Usage:
dag = {
    '5': ['11'],
    '7': ['11', '8'],
    '3': ['8', '10'],
    '11': ['2', '9', '10'],

\end{lstlisting}
\marginpar{Cycle detection in directed graphs leverages DFS with a recursion stack to identify back edges indicating cycles.}

\textbf{Advanced Graph Concepts}

\subsection{Graph Coloring}

\textbf{Description:}  
Assigning colors to vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. The minimum number of colors needed for such an assignment is called the graph's chromatic number.

\textbf{Applications:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Scheduling problems.
    \item Register allocation in compilers.
    \item Map coloring.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Python Implementation (Greedy Coloring):}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, xleftmargin=0.02\textwidth, xrightmargin=0.02\textwidth]
def greedy_coloring(graph):
    color_assignment = {}
    for vertex in graph:
        available_colors = set(range(len(graph)))
        for neighbor in graph[vertex]:
            if neighbor in color_assignment:
                available_colors.discard(color_assignment[neighbor])
        color_assignment[vertex] = min(available_colors)
    return color_assignment

# Example Usage:
graph = {
    'A': ['B', 'C', 'D'],
    'B': ['A', 'C'],
    'C': ['A', 'B', 'D'],
    'D': ['A', 'C']
}

colors = greedy_coloring(graph)
print("\nGraph Coloring Assignment:")
for vertex in colors:
    print(f"Vertex {vertex}: Color {colors[vertex]}")
# Possible Output:
# Vertex A: Color 0
# Vertex B: Color 1
# Vertex C: Color 2
# Vertex D: Color 1
\end{lstlisting}
\marginpar{Graph coloring solves problems where conflicting assignments must be avoided, such as scheduling tasks without overlap.}

\subsection{Strongly Connected Components (SCCs)}

\textbf{Description:}  
In a directed graph, an SCC is a maximal subgraph where every vertex is reachable from every other vertex in the same subgraph.

\textbf{Algorithm:}  
Kosaraju's algorithm is a two-pass DFS-based method to identify all SCCs in a directed graph.

\textbf{Python Implementation (Kosaraju's Algorithm):}

def kosaraju_scc(graph):
    visited = set()
    stack = []
    
    # First DFS to fill stack
    def fill_order(v):
        visited.add(v)
        for neighbor in graph[v]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                fill_order(neighbor)
        stack.append(v)
    
    for vertex in graph:
        if vertex not in visited:
            fill_order(vertex)
    
    # Transpose the graph
    transpose = {v: [] for v in graph}
    for v in graph:
        for neighbor in graph[v]:
            transpose[neighbor].append(v)
    
    # Second DFS on transposed graph
    visited.clear()
    scc = []
    
    def dfs_transpose(v, component):
        visited.add(v)
        component.append(v)
        for neighbor in transpose[v]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                dfs_transpose(neighbor, component)
    
    while stack:
        v = stack.pop()
        if v not in visited:
            component = []
            dfs_transpose(v, component)
            scc.append(component)
    
    return scc

# Example Usage:
directed_graph = {
    'A': ['B'],
    'B': ['C'],
    'C': ['A', 'D'],
    'D': ['E'],
    'E': ['F'],
    'F': ['D'],
    'G': ['F']
}

scc = kosaraju_scc(directed_graph)
print("\nStrongly Connected Components:")
for component in scc:
    print(component)
# Output:
# ['G']
# ['E', 'F', 'D']
# ['A', 'C', 'B']
\end{lstlisting}

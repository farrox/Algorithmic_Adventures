\label{chap:union_find}
\marginnote{This chapter covers the Union-Find data structure, its implementation, and applications, serving as a foundation for various related problems.}

The \textbf{Union-Find} data structure, also known as the Disjoint Set Union (DSU), is a powerful tool used to manage a collection of disjoint sets. It provides efficient operations to merge sets and determine whether elements belong to the same set. This data structure is fundamental in solving problems related to connectivity, such as finding connected components in a graph, detecting cycles, and managing equivalence relations.

\section*{Problem Statement}

Design a \texttt{UnionFind} class that supports the following operations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{UnionFind(int size)}: Initializes the Union-Find structure with \texttt{size} elements, each in their own set.
    \item \texttt{int find(int x)}: Returns the representative (root) of the set containing element \texttt{x}.
    \item \texttt{void union(int x, int y)}: Merges the sets containing elements \texttt{x} and \texttt{y}.
    \item \texttt{boolean connected(int x, int y)}: Returns \texttt{true} if elements \texttt{x} and \texttt{y} are in the same set, and \texttt{false} otherwise.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example:}

\textit{Example 1:}

\begin{verbatim}
Input:
["UnionFind","find","union","find","connected","find"]
[[10], [1], [1,2], [2], [1,2], [3]]

Output:
[null,1,null,1,true,3]

Explanation:
UnionFind uf = new UnionFind(10);
uf.find(1);          // returns 1
uf.union(1, 2);
uf.find(2);          // returns 1
uf.connected(1, 2);  // returns true
uf.find(3);          // returns 3
\end{verbatim}

\section*{Algorithmic Approach}

The Union-Find data structure efficiently manages a collection of disjoint sets by supporting two primary operations:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Find:} Determines which subset a particular element is in. This can be used for determining if two elements are in the same subset.
    
    \item \textbf{Union:} Merges two subsets into a single subset.
\end{enumerate}

To optimize these operations, two key techniques are employed:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Path Compression:} During the \texttt{find} operation, path compression flattens the structure of the tree, making future \texttt{find} operations faster by pointing each traversed node directly to the root.
    
    \item \textbf{Union by Rank:} When performing a \texttt{union}, the root of the smaller tree is made to point to the root of the larger tree. This helps in keeping the tree shallow, optimizing the \texttt{find} operation.
\end{itemize}

\marginnote{Combining path compression and union by rank ensures that the amortized time complexity of each operation is nearly constant, specifically \(O(\alpha(n))\), where \(\alpha\) is the inverse Ackermann function.}

\section*{Complexities}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Time Complexity:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{find}: \(O(\alpha(n))\), where \(\alpha\) is the inverse Ackermann function.
        \item \texttt{union}: \(O(\alpha(n))\).
        \item \texttt{connected}: \(O(\alpha(n))\).
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Space Complexity:} \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements. This space is used to store the parent and rank arrays.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Python Implementation}

\marginnote{Implementing Union-Find with path compression and union by rank ensures optimal performance for dynamic connectivity queries.}

Below is the complete Python code that implements the \textbf{UnionFind} class to solve the problem:

\begin{fullwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self, size: int):
        self.parent = [i for i in range(size)]
        self.rank = [1] * size

    def find(self, x: int) -> int:
        if self.parent[x] != x:
            # Path compression
            self.parent[x] = self.find(self.parent[x])
        return self.parent[x]

    def union(self, x: int, y: int) -> None:
        rootX = self.find(x)
        rootY = self.find(y)

        if rootX == rootY:
            return

        # Union by rank
        if self.rank[rootX] > self.rank[rootY]:
            self.parent[rootY] = rootX
        elif self.rank[rootX] < self.rank[rootY]:
            self.parent[rootX] = rootY
        else:
            self.parent[rootY] = rootX
            self.rank[rootX] += 1

    def connected(self, x: int, y: int) -> bool:
        return self.find(x) == self.find(y)

# Example usage:
uf = UnionFind(10)
print(uf.find(1))          # Output: 1
uf.union(1, 2)
print(uf.find(2))          # Output: 1
print(uf.connected(1, 2))  # Output: True
print(uf.find(3))          # Output: 3
\end{lstlisting}
\end{fullwidth}

\section*{Explanation}

The \textbf{UnionFind} class is designed to efficiently manage a collection of disjoint sets. Here's a detailed breakdown of the implementation:

\subsection*{Data Structures}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{parent}:  
    An array where \texttt{parent[i]} represents the parent of element \texttt{i}. Initially, each element is its own parent, indicating that each element is in its own set.
    
    \item \texttt{rank}:  
    An array used to keep track of the depth of trees. This helps in optimizing the \texttt{union} operation by attaching the shorter tree under the root of the taller tree.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Find Operation (\texttt{find(x)})}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Check if \texttt{x} is its own parent. If it is, then \texttt{x} is the root of its set.
    \item If \texttt{x} is not its own parent, recursively call \texttt{find} on \texttt{x}'s parent to find the root.
    \item During the recursion, apply path compression by setting the parent of each traversed node directly to the root. This flattens the structure of the tree, ensuring that future \texttt{find} operations are faster.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Union Operation (\texttt{union(x, y)})}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Find the roots of both \texttt{x} and \texttt{y} using the \texttt{find} operation.
    \item If both elements have the same root, they are already in the same set, and no further action is needed.
    \item If they have different roots, perform a union by rank:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Attach the tree with the lower rank under the root of the tree with the higher rank.
        \item If both trees have the same rank, arbitrarily choose one root to be the parent and increment its rank by 1.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Connected Operation (\texttt{connected(x, y)})}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Use the \texttt{find} operation to determine the roots of \texttt{x} and \texttt{y}.
    \item If both roots are the same, the elements are in the same set; otherwise, they are in different sets.
\end{enumerate}

This implementation ensures that both the \texttt{find} and \texttt{union} operations are highly efficient, making it suitable for handling large datasets with up to \(10^5\) operations.

\section*{Why This Approach}

Using the Union-Find data structure with path compression and union by rank offers several advantages:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Efficiency:}  
    Both \texttt{find} and \texttt{union} operations have nearly constant time complexity, making them suitable for large-scale problems.
    
    \item \textbf{Simplicity:}  
    The implementation is straightforward and easy to understand, facilitating quick development and debugging.
    
    \item \textbf{Optimal for Connectivity Problems:}  
    Union-Find is particularly effective in solving problems related to connectivity, such as finding connected components, detecting cycles, and managing equivalence relations.
    
    \item \textbf{Space Optimization:}  
    The data structure uses minimal additional space, maintaining only parent and rank arrays.
\end{itemize}

This approach is optimal for scenarios where multiple union and find operations need to be performed efficiently on a dynamic set of elements.

\section*{Alternative Approaches}

While Union-Find is highly efficient for managing disjoint sets, alternative methods include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Graph Traversal Algorithms:}  
    Algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) can be used to determine connectivity in graphs. However, these methods are generally less efficient for dynamic connectivity queries compared to Union-Find.
    
    \item \textbf{Adjacency Lists or Matrices:}  
    Representing connectivity using adjacency lists or matrices allows for explicit tracking of connections but can consume more space and offer slower query times for connectivity.
    
    \item \textbf{Dynamic Trees:}  
    Advanced data structures like Link-Cut Trees can handle dynamic connectivity with additional operations but are more complex to implement and manage.
\end{itemize}

These alternatives typically have higher time and space complexities or are more complex to implement, making Union-Find the preferred choice for most connectivity-related problems.

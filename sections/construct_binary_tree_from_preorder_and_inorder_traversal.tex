\problemsection{Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal}\marginpar{Reconstruct a binary tree given its preorder and inorder traversal sequences using recursive strategies.}

\textbf{Problem Statement}

Given two integer arrays \texttt{preorder} and \texttt{inorder} where \texttt{preorder} is the preorder traversal of a binary tree and \texttt{inorder} is the inorder traversal of the same tree, construct and return the binary tree.

\textbf{Algorithmic Approach}

To reconstruct the binary tree from its preorder and inorder traversal sequences, we can utilize the properties of these traversals:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Understanding Traversal Properties}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Preorder Traversal}: Visits nodes in the order of Root, Left, Right.
        \item \textbf{Inorder Traversal}: Visits nodes in the order of Left, Root, Right.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Recursive Reconstruction}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Identify Root}: The first element in the preorder traversal is the root of the tree.
        \item \textbf{Locate Root in Inorder Traversal}: Find the index of the root in the inorder traversal. This index divides the inorder list into left and right subtrees.
        \item \textbf{Determine Subtree Sizes}: The number of elements to the left of the root in inorder traversal corresponds to the number of nodes in the left subtree.
        \item \textbf{Recursively Construct Subtrees}:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{Left Subtree}: Use the next set of elements in preorder corresponding to the left subtree and the left segment of inorder traversal.
            \item \textbf{Right Subtree}: Use the subsequent elements in preorder corresponding to the right subtree and the right segment of inorder traversal.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Complexities}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Time Complexity}: \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is processed exactly once.
    \item \textbf{Space Complexity}: \(O(N)\), due to the space required for the recursion stack and the hashmap storing inorder indices.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Python Implementation}\marginpar{Implementing a recursive solution to reconstruct the binary tree from traversal sequences.}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, xleftmargin=0.02\textwidth, xrightmargin=0.02\textwidth]
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def buildTree(self, preorder: list, inorder: list) -> TreeNode:
        if not preorder or not inorder:
            return None
        
        # Map from value to its index in inorder traversal for quick lookup
        inorder_index_map = {value: idx for idx, value in enumerate(inorder)}
        
        # Recursive helper function
        def array_to_tree(pre_left, pre_right, in_left, in_right):
            if pre_left > pre_right:
                return None
            
            # Root value is the first element in the current preorder slice
            root_val = preorder[pre_left]
            root = TreeNode(root_val)
            
            # Index of the root in inorder traversal
            in_root_index = inorder_index_map[root_val]
            
            # Number of nodes in the left subtree
            left_tree_size = in_root_index - in_left
            
            # Recursively build the left and right subtrees
            root.left = array_to_tree(pre_left + 1, pre_left + left_tree_size, in_left, in_root_index - 1)
            root.right = array_to_tree(pre_left + left_tree_size + 1, pre_right, in_root_index + 1, in_right)
            
            return root
        
        # Initialize recursion boundaries
        return array_to_tree(0, len(preorder) - 1, 0, len(inorder) - 1)

# Example usage:
# Preorder traversal: [3,9,20,15,7]
# Inorder traversal: [9,3,15,20,7]
preorder = [3,9,20,15,7]
inorder = [9,3,15,20,7]

solution = Solution()
tree_root = solution.buildTree(preorder, inorder)

# Function to print inorder traversal of the constructed tree
def print_inorder(node):
    if not node:
        return
    print_inorder(node.left)
    print(node.val, end=' ')
    print_inorder(node.right)

print_inorder(tree_root)  # Output: 9 3 15 20 7 
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{Explanation}

The function \texttt{buildTree} reconstructs the binary tree from its preorder and inorder traversal lists by leveraging the following insights:

\begin{itemize}
    \item **Root Identification**: The first element in the preorder list is always the root of the tree or subtree being constructed.
    \item **Inorder Index Mapping**: By creating a hashmap (\texttt{inorder\_index\_map}) that maps each value to its index in the inorder list, we can quickly determine the boundaries of left and right subtrees.
    \item **Recursive Construction**:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item **Base Case**: If the current slice of the preorder list is empty (\texttt{pre\_left > pre\_right}), return \texttt{None}, indicating no subtree exists.
        \item **Node Creation**: Create a new \texttt{TreeNode} with the root value.
        \item **Left Subtree Size**: Calculate the number of nodes in the left subtree using the root's index in the inorder list.
        \item **Recursive Calls**: 
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item **Left Subtree**: Construct the left subtree using the corresponding slices of preorder and inorder lists.
            \item **Right Subtree**: Similarly, construct the right subtree.
        \end{enumerate}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Why This Approach}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Efficiency}: By using a hashmap to store inorder indices, we reduce the time complexity of searching for root positions from \(O(N)\) to \(O(1)\), ensuring overall linear time complexity.
    \item \textbf{Simplicity and Clarity}: The recursive approach aligns naturally with the hierarchical structure of binary trees, making the code intuitive and easy to understand.
    \item \textbf{Optimal Space Utilization}: Although recursion introduces additional space complexity due to the call stack, this approach remains optimal for tree reconstruction problems.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Alternative Approaches}

An alternative method involves using iterative tree construction techniques with stacks to simulate the recursion process. However, this approach can be more complex and less intuitive compared to the straightforward recursive method. Additionally, it may not offer significant performance benefits over the recursive approach.

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Things to Keep in Mind and Tricks}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Unique Elements Assumption}: This approach assumes that all elements in the tree are unique. If duplicates are allowed, additional handling is required to correctly identify subtree boundaries.
    \item \textbf{Preorder and Inorder Traversal Validity}: Ensure that the provided preorder and inorder traversal lists are valid and correspond to the same binary tree.
    \item \textbf{Recursive Boundaries}: Carefully manage the indices for the current slices of preorder and inorder lists to avoid incorrect subtree constructions.
    \item \textbf{Handling Edge Cases}: Consider scenarios where the tree is empty, has only one node, or is highly unbalanced (e.g., skewed trees).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Corner and Special Cases to Test When Writing the Code}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Empty Tree}: Both preorder and inorder lists are empty. The function should return \texttt{None}.
    \item \textbf{Single Node Tree}: Preorder and inorder lists contain only one element. The function should correctly create a single-node tree.
    \item \textbf{Left-Skewed Tree}: All nodes have only left children. Verify that the tree is constructed correctly without missing nodes.
    \item \textbf{Right-Skewed Tree}: All nodes have only right children. Ensure accurate tree reconstruction.
    \item \textbf{Balanced Tree}: A perfectly balanced tree to confirm that both left and right subtrees are constructed accurately.
    \item \textbf{Invalid Traversals}: Preorder and inorder lists that do not correspond to the same tree. The function should handle such cases gracefully, potentially by returning an error or \texttt{None}.
    \item \textbf{Large Tree}: Test with a large number of nodes to assess the performance and recursion depth handling.
    \item \textbf{Duplicate Values}: If duplicates are allowed, ensure that the function correctly identifies the positions of duplicate elements in the inorder list.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Strings: Algorithms and Data Structures}
\label{chap:Strings}

A string is a sequence of characters, often representing textual data, but strings can also encode structured information in fields, patterns, or tokens. Strings are one of the most fundamental data types in computer science and are closely related to arrays since each character in a string can be indexed similarly to array elements. As such, many techniques and tips that apply to arrays also extend to strings. However, strings come with their own set of unique challenges and require specialized algorithms and data structures for efficient manipulation and searching.

In this chapter, we will explore various string algorithms and data structures, with a focus on both foundational and advanced techniques. Understanding these methods is crucial for solving a wide range of problems, from basic substring search to complex pattern matching.

\section*{Common Data Structures for Strings}
Efficient string manipulation and searching often rely on specialized data structures tailored to the properties of strings. Here are some of the most commonly used data structures:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Trie (Prefix Tree):}  
    A tree-like data structure used to store a dynamic set of strings, where each node represents a single character. Tries are particularly effective for prefix-based searches, such as auto-complete or finding all words with a given prefix\sidenote{The time complexity of prefix search in a trie is proportional to the length of the prefix, \(O(m)\), where \(m\) is the prefix length}.
    
    \item \textbf{Suffix Tree:}  
    A compressed trie specifically built for all suffixes of a string. Suffix trees are powerful for solving problems like finding the longest repeated substring or checking if a string is a substring of another string\sidenote{Suffix trees provide linear time complexity, \(O(n)\), for many string operations, where \(n\) is the length of the string}.
    
    \item \textbf{Suffix Array:}  
    A space-efficient alternative to suffix trees, often used with additional data structures like LCP (Longest Common Prefix) arrays to solve similar problems with reduced memory overhead.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Common String Algorithms}
Solving string-related problems often requires efficient algorithms for searching, pattern matching, or transforming strings. Some of the most notable algorithms include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Rabin-Karp Algorithm:}  
    A rolling hash-based algorithm for efficient substring searching. By computing a hash value for the pattern and comparing it with hash values of substrings in the text, the algorithm avoids character-by-character comparison\sidenote{The average time complexity of Rabin-Karp is \(O(n + m)\), where \(n\) is the text length and \(m\) is the pattern length}.
    
    \item \textbf{Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm:}  
    An efficient substring search algorithm that preprocesses the pattern to build a partial match table (prefix table), allowing the search to skip unnecessary comparisons\sidenote{The KMP algorithm runs in \(O(n + m)\) time for text of length \(n\) and pattern of length \(m\)}.
    
    \item \textbf{Z-Algorithm:}  
    Computes the Z-array, which provides the length of the substring starting from each position in the text that matches the prefix. This algorithm is useful for pattern matching and finding repetitions\sidenote{Z-algorithm processes the string in linear time, \(O(n)\)}.
    
    \item \textbf{Manacher's Algorithm:}  
    A specialized algorithm for finding the longest palindromic substring in linear time.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Common Problems with Strings}
Strings often form the basis of a wide variety of problems. Some notable examples include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters:} Use sliding window techniques to identify the largest substring with unique characters.
    \item \textbf{Find All Anagrams in a String:} Leverage frequency counting and window techniques to locate all permutations of a pattern within a string.
    \item \textbf{String Matching:} Efficiently search for patterns in large texts using Rabin-Karp or KMP.
    \item \textbf{Regular Expression Matching:} Implement dynamic programming to handle wildcard-based pattern matching.
    \item \textbf{Edit Distance (Levenshtein Distance):} Use dynamic programming to calculate the minimum number of operations required to transform one string into another.
\end{itemize}

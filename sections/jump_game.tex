\problemsection{Jump Game I}
\label{problem:jump_game_i}
\marginnote{This problem employs a greedy algorithm to determine if the end of the array can be reached.}

The \textbf{Jump Game I} problem is a well-known challenge in LeetCode's array and dynamic programming category. The goal is to determine if it is possible to reach the final index of an array, where each element represents the maximum jump length from that position.

\section*{Problem Statement}

Given an array of non-negative integers \texttt{nums}, where \texttt{nums[i]} is the maximum jump length at position \(i\), the task is to decide whether it is possible to reach the last index starting from the first index. The output should be a boolean, \texttt{true} if you can reach the last index, otherwise \texttt{false}.

\textbf{Example 1:}
\begin{verbatim}
Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: true
Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Example 2:}
\begin{verbatim}
Input: nums = [3,2,1,0,4]
Output: false
Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.
\end{verbatim}

\section*{Algorithmic Approach}

To solve the \textbf{Jump Game I} problem, we employ a \textbf{greedy algorithm}. The approach involves iterating through the array and at each position, updating the maximum reachable index. If at any point the current index exceeds the maximum reachable index, it means the end cannot be reached. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Initialization:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Initialize a variable \texttt{max\_reachable} to keep track of the furthest index that can be reached.
        \item Set \texttt{max\_reachable} to the first element of the array.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Iteration:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Iterate through each index \(i\) of the array.
        \item If the current index \(i\) is greater than \texttt{max\_reachable}, return \texttt{false} as it means the end cannot be reached.
        \item Update \texttt{max\_reachable} to be the maximum of its current value and \(i + \texttt{nums[i]}\).
        \item If \texttt{max\_reachable} is greater than or equal to the last index, return \texttt{true}.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Termination:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item After completing the iteration, if \texttt{max\_reachable} is greater than or equal to the last index, return \texttt{true}; otherwise, return \texttt{false}.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

This method ensures that we can determine the possibility of reaching the end by making optimal jump choices at each step without exploring all possible jump combinations.

\marginnote{The greedy approach efficiently determines reachability by always making the farthest possible jump.}

\section*{Complexities}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Time Complexity:} \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the input array. We traverse the array once.
    \item \textbf{Space Complexity:} \(O(1)\), since we only use a few extra variables for tracking.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Python Implementation}

\marginnote{Multiple implementation approaches demonstrate different trade-offs between readability and optimization.}

Below are three implementations: the standard greedy solution, an optimized version, and a solution that returns the actual path:

        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if i > max_reachable:
                return False
            max_reachable = max(max_reachable, i + nums[i])
            if max_reachable >= last_index:
                return True
        
        return False

    def canJumpOptimized(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:

        max_reachable = nums[0]
        i = 0
        
        while i <= max_reachable and max_reachable < len(nums) - 1:
            max_reachable = max(max_reachable, i + nums[i])
            i += 1
            
        return max_reachable >= len(nums) - 1

    def findPath(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        """Returns the actual path of jumps to reach the end."""
        if not self.canJump(nums):
            return []
            
        path = [0]  # Start position
        pos = 0
        while pos < len(nums) - 1:
            best_jump = pos
            max_reach = 0
            
            # Find the best jump position
            for j in range(pos + 1, min(pos + nums[pos] + 1, len(nums))):
                if j + nums[j] >= max_reach:
                    max_reach = j + nums[j]
                    best_jump = j
                    
            pos = best_jump
            path.append(pos)
            
        return path

\section*{Explanation}

The `canJump` function determines whether it is possible to reach the last index of the array starting from the first index. Here's a detailed breakdown of the implementation:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Initialization:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{max\_reachable:} This variable keeps track of the furthest index that can be reached at any point during the iteration.
        \item \texttt{last\_index:} This is the index of the last element in the array, which is the target we aim to reach.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Iteration:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Loop through the array:} For each index \(i\), check if it is within the current \texttt{max\_reachable}. If \(i\) is greater than \texttt{max\_reachable}, it means the current index cannot be reached, and hence, the last index is unreachable.
        \item \textbf{Update max\_reachable:} Update \texttt{max\_reachable} to be the maximum of its current value and \(i + \texttt{nums[i]}\), which represents the furthest index reachable from the current position.
        \item \textbf{Early termination:} If at any point \texttt{max\_reachable} becomes greater than or equal to \texttt{last\_index}, return \texttt{True} immediately as the end is reachable.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Final Check:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item After completing the loop, return \texttt{False} if the end was not reachable during the iteration.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section*{Why This Approach}

The greedy algorithm is chosen for its efficiency and simplicity. By always tracking the furthest we can reach at each step, we can solve the problem by making a single pass through the array, thus achieving a linear time complexity. This approach avoids the need for more complex methods like dynamic programming or recursion, making it both optimal and easy to implement.

\section*{Alternative Approaches}

An alternative approach would be to use \textbf{dynamic programming} to solve the problem. This would involve building an array where each element represents whether you can reach the current position from the start. However, this approach has a higher time complexity of \(O(n^2)\), making it less efficient compared to the greedy algorithm.

Another approach could involve using \textbf{breadth-first search (BFS)}, where each position in the array is considered as a node in a graph, and edges represent possible jumps. While BFS can be used to determine reachability, it also results in higher time and space complexities compared to the greedy method.

The greedy algorithm remains the most optimal and straightforward method for this problem due to its linear time complexity and constant space usage.

\section*{Things to Keep in Mind and Tricks}

When solving greedy algorithm problems like this one, consider the following tips:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Track the Maximum Reachable Index:} Always keep track of the furthest index that can be reached so far. This helps in making optimal jump decisions.
    \index{Track the Maximum Reachable Index}
    
    \item \textbf{Early Termination:} If the maximum reachable index is greater than or equal to the last index at any point during the iteration, you can terminate early and return \texttt{True}.
    \index{Early Termination}
    
    \item \textbf{Handle Edge Cases:} Consider cases where the array contains only one element, or where early elements are zero, preventing any progress.
    \index{Handle Edge Cases}
    
    \item \textbf{Iterate Only Up to Current Maximum Reachable:} There's no need to iterate beyond the current maximum reachable index, as those positions cannot be reached.

    \item \textbf{Optimize Space Usage:} The greedy approach typically uses constant space, making it highly efficient in terms of memory.

\section*{Corner and Special Cases to Test When Writing the Code}

When implementing the `canJump` function, it is crucial to test the following edge cases to ensure robustness:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Single Element Array:} `nums = [0]` should return `True` as you are already at the last index.
    \index{Corner Cases}
    
    \item \textbf{Early Zero Blocking:} `nums = [0,1]` should return `False` since you cannot move from the first index.
    \index{Corner Cases}
    
    \item \textbf{All Ones:} `nums = [1,1,1,1]` should return `True`.
    \index{Corner Cases}
    
    \item \textbf{No Possible Jump to End:} `nums = [3,2,1,0,4]` should return `False`.
    \index{Corner Cases}
    
    \item \textbf{Large Array with Valid Path:} A large array where each element allows jumping to the end should return `True`.
    \index{Corner Cases}
    
    \item \textbf{Array with Last Element Zero:} `nums = [2,3,1,1,0]` should return `True`.
    \index{Corner Cases}
    
    \item \textbf{Array with Multiple Paths:} `nums = [2,3,1,1,4]` should return `True` with multiple jump paths.
    \index{Corner Cases}
    
    \item \textbf{Array Starting with Zero:} `nums = [0,2,3]` should return `False`.
    \index{Corner Cases}
    
    \item \textbf{Maximum Jump Reaches Beyond End:} `nums = [1,4,2,6,7,6,5,1,4,2,9]` should return `True`.
    \index{Corner Cases}
    
    \item \textbf{Empty Array:} Depending on problem constraints, `nums = []` might need to be handled gracefully.

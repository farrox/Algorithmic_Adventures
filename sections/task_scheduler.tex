\problemsection{Task Scheduler}
\label{problem:task_scheduler}
\marginnote{This problem utilizes a greedy algorithm and frequency counting to efficiently schedule tasks with cooldown constraints.}

The \textbf{Task Scheduler} problem is a classic algorithmic challenge that involves determining the minimum number of time units required to execute a list of tasks given specific cooldown constraints. Each task is represented by a character, and the cooldown period \( n \) dictates the minimum number of time units that must pass before the same task can be executed again.

\section*{Problem Statement}

Given a list of tasks represented by characters and a non-negative integer \( n \) representing the cooldown period between two identical tasks, return the least number of time units that the CPU will take to finish all the given tasks. The CPU can either execute a task or be idle in each unit of time. Each task takes exactly one unit of time.

\textbf{Example 1:}
\begin{verbatim}
Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B.
Total time units = 8.
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Example 2:}
\begin{verbatim}
Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 0
Output: 6
Explanation: A -> A -> A -> B -> B -> B.
Total time units = 6.
\end{verbatim}

\section*{Algorithmic Approach}

\subsection*{Main Concept}
The main idea to solve this problem is to use a greedy algorithm combined with frequency counting of tasks. The steps are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Frequency Count:} Count the frequency of each task.
    \item \textbf{Identify Maximum Frequency:} Determine the task(s) with the highest frequency.
    \item \textbf{Calculate Initial Slots:} Calculate the number of idle slots based on the highest frequency and cooldown period.
    \item \textbf{Fill Idle Slots:} Assign remaining tasks to these idle slots to minimize the total time.
    \item \textbf{Determine Final Answer:} The final answer is the maximum between the length of the tasks list and the total calculated slots.
\end{enumerate}

\marginnote{Using frequency counts ensures that the most frequent tasks are scheduled optimally to minimize idle time.}

\section*{Complexities}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Time Complexity:} \( O(N) \), where \( N \) is the number of tasks. Counting frequencies and iterating through the frequency list both take linear time.
	\item \textbf{Space Complexity:} \( O(1) \) since the frequency array has a fixed size of 26 (for each uppercase English letter).
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

\section*{Explanation}

The provided Python implementation defines a function `leastInterval` which takes a list of tasks and an integer `n` representing the cooldown period. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the implementation:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Edge Case Handling:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If the cooldown period `n` is 0, there are no restrictions on task execution order, so the minimum time is simply the number of tasks.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Frequency Counting:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Use `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each task.
        \item Identify `max-freq`, the highest frequency among all tasks.
        \item Determine `max-freq-tasks`, the number of tasks that have this highest frequency.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Calculating Idle Slots:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item `part-count` is the number of full parts between the most frequent tasks, calculated as `max-freq - 1`.
        \item `part-length` is the length of each part, which is `n - (max-freq-tasks - 1)`. This accounts for the fact that multiple tasks with the same highest frequency can fill some of the idle slots.
        \item `empty-slots` is the total number of idle slots available, calculated as `part-count * part-length`.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Filling Idle Slots:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item `available-tasks` is the number of tasks that are not the most frequent ones.
        \item `idles` is the number of idle slots that remain after filling with available tasks, calculated as `max(0, empty-slots - available-tasks)`.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Determining the Final Answer:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The minimum time required is the sum of the total number of tasks and the number of idle slots.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

This approach ensures that tasks are scheduled in a way that minimizes idle time by prioritizing the most frequent tasks and efficiently utilizing available slots.

\section*{Why This Approach}

The greedy algorithm is chosen for its efficiency and effectiveness in handling the problem's constraints. By focusing on the most frequent tasks and strategically placing them to minimize idle time, this approach ensures an optimal schedule. It avoids the need for more complex methods like dynamic programming, resulting in a simpler and faster solution.

\section*{Alternative Approaches}

An alternative approach involves using a priority queue (max heap) to always select the task with the highest remaining frequency that can be executed next, adhering to the cooldown constraint. This method can also achieve \( O(N) \) time complexity but may have a higher constant factor due to heap operations. Additionally, dynamic programming techniques can be employed, but they tend to be more complex and less intuitive for this specific problem.

    \item \textbf{All Tasks Identical:} All tasks are the same, requiring maximum cooldown.

    \item \textbf{No Cooldown (n = 0):} Should return the length of the tasks list.
    \index{Corner Cases}
    
    \item \textbf{Multiple Tasks with Maximum Frequency:} Multiple tasks share the highest frequency, affecting idle slot calculations.
    \index{Corner Cases}
    
    \item \textbf{Cooldown Greater Than Tasks:} The cooldown period is larger than the number of tasks.
    \index{Corner Cases}
    
    \item \textbf{Single Task:} Only one task is present.
    \index{Corner Cases}
    
    \item \textbf{Empty Task List:} Should handle gracefully, possibly returning 0.
    \index{Corner Cases}
    
    \item \textbf{Large Number of Tasks:} Ensure the algorithm handles large inputs efficiently without exceeding time limits.
    \index{Corner Cases}
    
    \item \textbf{Tasks with High \( k \) Values:} Tasks require large cooldown periods relative to their frequencies.

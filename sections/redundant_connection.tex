\label{problem:redundant_connection}
\marginnote{This problem utilizes the Union-Find data structure to identify and remove a redundant connection that creates a cycle in an undirected graph.}
    
The \textbf{Redundant Connection} problem involves identifying an edge in an undirected graph that, if removed, will eliminate a cycle and restore the graph to a tree structure. The graph initially forms a tree with \(n\) nodes labeled from 1 to \(n\), and then one additional edge is added. The task is to find and return this redundant edge.

\section*{Problem Statement}

You are given a graph that started as a tree with \(n\) nodes labeled from 1 to \(n\), with one additional edge added. The additional edge connects two different vertices chosen from 1 to \(n\), and it is not an edge that already existed. The resulting graph is given as a 2D-array \texttt{edges} where \texttt{edges[i] = [ai, bi]} indicates that there is an edge between nodes \texttt{ai} and \texttt{bi} in the graph.

Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of \(n\) nodes. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the input.

\textbf{Example:}

\textit{Example 1:}

\begin{verbatim}
Input:
edges = [[1,2], [1,3], [2,3]]

Output:
[2,3]

Explanation:
Removing the edge [2,3] will result in a tree.
\end{verbatim}

\textit{Example 2:}

\begin{verbatim}
Input:
edges = [[1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [1,4], [1,5]]

Output:
[1,4]

Explanation:
Removing the edge [1,4] will result in a tree.

\section*{Algorithmic Approach}

To efficiently identify the redundant connection that forms a cycle in the graph, the Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) data structure is employed. Union-Find is particularly effective in managing and merging disjoint sets, which aligns perfectly with the task of detecting cycles in an undirected graph.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Initialize Union-Find Structure:}  
    Each node starts as its own parent, indicating that each node is initially in its own set.
    
    \item \textbf{Process Each Edge:}  
    Iterate through each edge \((u, v)\) in the \texttt{edges} list:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Use the \texttt{find} operation to determine the root parents of nodes \(u\) and \(v\).
        \item If both nodes share the same root parent, the current edge \((u, v)\) forms a cycle and is the redundant connection. Return this edge.
        \item If the nodes have different root parents, perform a \texttt{union} operation to merge the sets containing \(u\) and \(v\).
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\marginnote{Using Union-Find with path compression and union by rank optimizes the operations, ensuring near-constant time complexity for each union and find operation.}

\section*{Complexities}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Time Complexity:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{Union-Find Operations}: Each \texttt{find} and \texttt{union} operation takes nearly \(O(1)\) time due to optimizations like path compression and union by rank.
        \item \texttt{Processing All Edges}: \(O(E \cdot \alpha(n))\), where \(E\) is the number of edges and \(\alpha\) is the inverse Ackermann function, which grows very slowly.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Space Complexity:} \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes. This space is used to store the parent and rank arrays.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Python Implementation}

\marginnote{Implementing Union-Find with path compression and union by rank ensures optimal performance for cycle detection in graphs.}

Below is the complete Python code using the Union-Find algorithm with path compression for finding the redundant connection in an undirected graph:

\begin{fullwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.parent = [i for i in range(size + 1)]  # Nodes are labeled from 1 to n
        self.rank = [1] * (size + 1)

    def find(self, x):
        if self.parent[x] != x:
            self.parent[x] = self.find(self.parent[x])  # Path compression
        return self.parent[x]

    def union(self, x, y):
        rootX = self.find(x)
        rootY = self.find(y)

        if rootX == rootY:
            return False  # Cycle detected

        # Union by rank
        if self.rank[rootX] > self.rank[rootY]:
            self.parent[rootY] = rootX
            self.rank[rootX] += self.rank[rootY]
        else:
            self.parent[rootX] = rootY
            if self.rank[rootX] == self.rank[rootY]:
                self.rank[rootY] += 1
        return True

class Solution:
    def findRedundantConnection(self, edges):
        uf = UnionFind(len(edges))
        for u, v in edges:
            if not uf.union(u, v):
                return [u, v]
        return []

# Example usage:
solution = Solution()
print(solution.findRedundantConnection([[1,2], [1,3], [2,3]]))       # Output: [2,3]
print(solution.findRedundantConnection([[1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [1,4], [1,5]]))  # Output: [1,4]
\end{lstlisting}
\end{fullwidth}

This implementation utilizes the Union-Find data structure to efficiently detect cycles within the graph. By iterating through each edge and performing union operations, the algorithm identifies the first edge that connects two nodes already in the same set, thereby forming a cycle. This edge is the redundant connection that can be removed to restore the graph to a tree structure.

\section*{Explanation}

The \textbf{Redundant Connection} class is designed to identify and return the redundant edge that forms a cycle in an undirected graph. Here's a detailed breakdown of the implementation:

\subsection*{Data Structures}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{parent}:  
    An array where \texttt{parent[i]} represents the parent of node \texttt{i}. Initially, each node is its own parent, indicating separate sets.
    
    \item \texttt{rank}:  
    An array used to keep track of the depth of each tree. This helps in optimizing the \texttt{union} operation by attaching the smaller tree under the root of the larger tree.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Union-Find Operations}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Find Operation (\texttt{find(x)})}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \texttt{find} determines the root parent of node \texttt{x}.
        \item Path compression is applied by recursively setting the parent of each traversed node directly to the root. This flattens the tree structure, optimizing future \texttt{find} operations.
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \item \textbf{Union Operation (\texttt{union(x, y)})}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Find the root parents of both nodes \texttt{x} and \texttt{y}.
        \item If both nodes share the same root parent, a cycle is detected, and the current edge \((x, y)\) is redundant. Return \texttt{False} to indicate that no union was performed.
        \item If the nodes have different root parents, perform a union by rank:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Attach the tree with the lower rank under the root of the tree with the higher rank.
            \item If both trees have the same rank, arbitrarily choose one as the new root and increment its rank by 1.
        \end{itemize}
        \item Return \texttt{True} to indicate that a successful union was performed without creating a cycle.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Solution Class (\texttt{Solution})}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Initialize the Union-Find structure with the number of nodes based on the length of the \texttt{edges} list.
    \item Iterate through each edge \((u, v)\) in the \texttt{edges} list:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Perform a \texttt{union} operation on nodes \(u\) and \(v\).
        \item If the \texttt{union} operation returns \texttt{False}, it indicates that adding this edge creates a cycle. Return this edge as the redundant connection.
    \end{itemize}
    \item If no redundant edge is found (which shouldn't happen as per the problem constraints), return an empty list.
\end{enumerate}

This approach ensures that each union and find operation is performed efficiently, resulting in an overall time complexity that is nearly linear with respect to the number of edges.

\section*{Why this Approach}

The Union-Find algorithm is particularly suited for this problem due to its ability to efficiently manage and merge disjoint sets while detecting cycles. Compared to other graph traversal methods like Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS), Union-Find offers superior performance in scenarios involving multiple connectivity queries and dynamic graph structures. The optimizations of path compression and union by rank further enhance its efficiency, making it an optimal choice for detecting redundant connections in large graphs.

\section*{Alternative Approaches}

While Union-Find is highly efficient for cycle detection, other methods can also be used to solve the \textbf{Redundant Connection} problem:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Depth-First Search (DFS):}  
    Iterate through each edge and perform DFS to check if adding the current edge creates a cycle. If a cycle is detected, the current edge is redundant. However, this approach has a higher time complexity compared to Union-Find, especially for large graphs.
    
    \item \textbf{Breadth-First Search (BFS):}  
    Similar to DFS, BFS can be used to detect cycles by traversing the graph level by level. This method also tends to be less efficient than Union-Find for this specific problem.
    
    \item \textbf{Graph Adjacency List with Cycle Detection:} 
    Build an adjacency list for the graph and use cycle detection algorithms to identify redundant edges. This approach requires maintaining additional data structures and typically has higher overhead.
\end{itemize}

These alternatives generally have higher time and space complexities or are more complex to implement, making Union-Find the preferred choice for this problem.

\section*{Similar Problems to This One}

This problem is closely related to several other connectivity and graph-related problems that utilize the Union-Find data structure:

\problemsection{Valid Parentheses}\marginpar{This classic problem uses stacks to check for balanced parentheses in expressions.}

\textbf{Problem Description:}  
Given a string containing just the characters \texttt{'('}, \texttt{')'}, \texttt{'{'}, \texttt{'}'}, \texttt{'['}, and \texttt{']'}, determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
    \item Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Solution Overview:}  
Use a stack to keep track of opening brackets. Iterate through the string, and for each character:
\begin{itemize}
    \item If it's an opening bracket (\texttt{'('}, \texttt{'['}, \texttt{'{'}) push it onto the stack.
    \item If it's a closing bracket (\texttt{')'}, \texttt{']'}, \texttt{'}'}), check if the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is the matching opening bracket. If so, pop the stack; otherwise, return \texttt{False}.
\end{itemize}
At the end, if the stack is empty, return \texttt{True}; otherwise, return \texttt{False}.

    for char in s:
        if char in mapping.values():
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in mapping:
            if not stack or mapping[char] != stack.pop():
                return False
        else:
            # Invalid character encountered
            return False
    return not stack

# Example usage:
print(isValid("()"))       # Output: True
print(isValid("()[]{}"))   # Output: True
print(isValid("(]"))       # Output: False

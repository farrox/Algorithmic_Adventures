\problemsection{Non-overlapping Intervals}
\label{problem:NonOverlappingIntervals}

The **Non-overlapping Intervals** problem is a variation of the interval scheduling and merging challenges. It requires determining the minimum number of intervals to remove from a collection so that the remaining intervals are non-overlapping. This problem is pivotal in optimizing resource allocation, such as meeting room scheduling, where minimizing conflicts is essential\sidenote{Efficiently resolving interval overlaps ensures optimal utilization of resources and prevents scheduling conflicts}.

\subsection*{Problem Statement}
Given a collection of intervals, find the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping\sidenote{Removing the least number of intervals ensures maximum utilization of available intervals while eliminating overlaps}.

\textbf{Example:}

\[
\begin{aligned}
\text{Input: } & [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]] \\
\text{Output: } & 1 \\
\text{Explanation: } & \text{Removing [1,3] leaves the rest of the intervals as non-overlapping}.
\end{aligned}
\]

\subsection*{Algorithmic Approach}
To solve the Non-overlapping Intervals problem efficiently, a greedy algorithm combined with sorting is employed\sidenote{Sorting intervals allows for the identification of overlaps in a structured manner, facilitating the optimal removal of intervals}.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Sort the Intervals:} Begin by sorting the intervals based on their end times.
    \sidenote{Sorting by end times ensures that intervals with earlier end times are considered first, maximizing the number of non-overlapping intervals}.
    
    \item \textbf{Initialize Tracking Variables:} 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item **End Pointer:** Initialize a pointer to keep track of the end of the last added interval, starting with the first interval's end.
        \sidenote{This pointer helps in determining whether the current interval overlaps with the last non-overlapping interval}.
        
        \item **Removal Counter:** Initialize a counter to track the number of intervals removed\sidenote{This counter will increment each time an overlapping interval is identified and removed}.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Iterate Through Intervals:} Traverse the sorted list of intervals and compare each interval's start time with the end pointer.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item **Check for Overlap:** If the current interval's start time is less than the end pointer, an overlap exists.
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item **Increment Removal Counter:** Increment the removal counter as one of the overlapping intervals needs to be removed\sidenote{Choosing which interval to remove is determined by the sorting order, favoring the interval with the earlier end time}.
                    
                    \item **Update End Pointer:** Update the end pointer to the minimum of the current interval's end and the last end pointer\sidenote{This ensures that the interval with the earliest end time is retained, allowing more intervals to fit without overlapping}.
                \end{itemize}
                
            \item **No Overlap:** If there is no overlap, update the end pointer to the current interval's end\sidenote{This sets the new reference point for subsequent interval comparisons}.
        \end{itemize}
    
    \item \textbf{Completion:} After processing all intervals, the removal counter will reflect the minimum number of intervals that need to be removed to eliminate all overlaps.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Python Implementation}
\begin{fullwidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
def eraseOverlapIntervals(intervals):
    """
    Finds the minimum number of intervals to remove to make the rest non-overlapping.
    
    Parameters:
    intervals (List[List[int]]): A list of intervals represented as [start, end].
    
    Returns:
    int: The minimum number of intervals that need to be removed.
    """
    if not intervals:
        return 0
    
    # Sort the intervals based on the end time
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
    
    end = intervals[0][1]
    count = 0
    
    for current in intervals[1:]:
        if current[0] < end:
            # Overlapping interval, increment removal counter
            count += 1
            # Update end to the minimum end time to maximize non-overlapping intervals
            end = min(end, current[1])
        else:
            # No overlap, update the end pointer
            end = current[1]
    
    return count

# Example usage:
intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
print(eraseOverlapIntervals(intervals))  # Output: 1
\end{lstlisting}
\end{fullwidth}

\subsection*{Why This Approach}
The greedy algorithm combined with sorting by end times is chosen for its **efficiency and optimality**. By sorting the intervals based on their end times, the algorithm ensures that intervals with earlier end times are prioritized, allowing for the maximum number of non-overlapping intervals to be selected\sidenote{This strategy minimizes the chances of future overlaps by choosing the interval that leaves the earliest possible room for subsequent intervals}. Consequently, the algorithm effectively identifies and removes the minimal number of overlapping intervals, achieving optimal performance with a time complexity of \( O(n \log n) \)\sidenote{The sorting step dominates the time complexity, while the subsequent traversal operates in linear time}.

\subsection*{Complexity Analysis}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Time Complexity:} \( O(n \log n) \)\sidenote{This arises from the sorting step, which is the most time-consuming part of the algorithm}.
    
    \item \textbf{Space Complexity:} \( O(1) \) if the sorting is done in-place\sidenote{Otherwise, it requires \( O(n) \) space depending on the sorting algorithm used}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Similar Problems}
Other problems that can be efficiently solved using greedy strategies and sorting techniques include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Interval Scheduling}: Select the maximum number of non-overlapping intervals\sidenote{Similar to Non-overlapping Intervals, but focuses on maximizing the number of intervals instead of minimizing removals}.
    
    \item \textbf{Meeting Rooms}: Determine if a person could attend all meetings given their schedules\sidenote{Requires checking for overlaps in meeting times, which can be efficiently handled by sorting intervals}.
    
    \item \textbf{Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons}: Find the minimum number of arrows needed to burst all balloons represented by intervals\sidenote{Involves identifying overlapping intervals to minimize the number of arrows used}.
    
    \item \textbf{Employee Free Time}: Find the common free time across all employees given their schedules\sidenote{Requires merging and identifying gaps between sorted intervals}.
\end{itemize}
These problems leverage the foundational principles of greedy algorithms and sorting, demonstrating the versatility and power of these techniques in various algorithmic contexts\sidenote{Mastering these approaches provides a strong foundation for solving a wide range of interval-related problems}.

\subsection*{Things to Keep in Mind and Tricks}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Sorting by End Time}: Always sort intervals based on their end times to ensure that the earliest finishing intervals are considered first\sidenote{This facilitates the selection of intervals that leave the most room for subsequent non-overlapping intervals}.
    
    \item \textbf{Handling Overlaps}: Carefully manage overlapping intervals by retaining the one with the earliest end time and removing others\sidenote{This strategy maximizes the number of non-overlapping intervals and minimizes removals}.
    
    \item \textbf{Edge Cases}: Ensure that the algorithm correctly handles edge cases such as empty input, single interval, and all intervals overlapping\sidenote{Robust handling of these scenarios prevents runtime errors and ensures correct results}.
    
    \item \textbf{In-Place Sorting}: If space is a concern, perform in-place sorting to reduce space overhead\sidenote{This can be achieved using sorting algorithms that do not require additional space, such as Heap Sort}.
    
    \item \textbf{Incrementing the Counter}: Only increment the removal counter when an actual overlap is detected\sidenote{This ensures that the count accurately reflects the number of necessary removals}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Corner and Special Cases to Test When Writing the Code}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Empty List}: Ensure the function returns 0 when given no intervals\sidenote{Handles scenarios where no data is provided gracefully}.
    
    \item \textbf{Single Interval}: Verify that a single interval results in no removals\sidenote{No overlapping is possible with a single interval}.
    
    \item \textbf{All Overlapping Intervals}: Test with all intervals overlapping to ensure that the algorithm correctly identifies the minimum number of removals\sidenote{Confirms that the algorithm consolidates overlaps efficiently}.
    
    \item \textbf{No Overlapping Intervals}: Ensure that the algorithm returns 0 when no overlaps are present\sidenote{Checks the algorithm's ability to recognize and preserve distinct intervals}.
    
    \item \textbf{Mixed Overlapping and Non-Overlapping Intervals}: Test with a combination of overlapping and non-overlapping intervals\sidenote{Validates the algorithm's capability to handle complex merging and removal scenarios}.
    
    \item \textbf{Intervals with Same Start or End Points}: Verify that intervals sharing start or end points are handled correctly\sidenote{Ensures accurate identification of overlaps when intervals have identical boundaries}.
